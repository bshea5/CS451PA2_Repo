- The OS that you compiled your code, and how to build/compile your code
	Mac OSX and Windows 7
	run the file with visual studio 2013 or a terminal
- Step to select a point.
	Click a point with your mouse. Mouse click location might vary between OS's
- Step to move a point.
	If a point is selected, drag the point. Camera won't rotate while a point is selected.
- Any extra information that I need to know.
	Using the first set of code given to us for Part one.

I added a bounding box to the 3D model with selectable vertices that can be 
moved with dragging of the mouse.  While a node is selected, the camera cannot
be moved. Enter arguements to use different models or to display a different size lattice.

Cheers.
