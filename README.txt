I added a bounding box to the 3D model with selectable vertices that can be 
moved with dragging of the mouse.  While a node is selected, that camera cannot
be moved. I will probabl just implement a button press later to allow the camera
to be still while dragging.  Enter arguements to use different models or to 
display a different size lattice

Cheers.
